# Windows Infrastructure Log Intelligence using GenAI

## Overview
This project analyzes Windows Event Logs to identify critical infrastructure
issues and uses Generative AI to convert technical signals into
business-friendly operational insights.

## Problem Statement
Enterprise Windows environments generate thousands of logs daily.
Manually identifying operational risks from these logs is time-consuming
and error-prone.

## Solution
- Filter critical Windows events relevant to authentication failures,
  service crashes, and application errors.
- Aggregate and analyze events using Python.
- Use Generative AI to summarize risks, probable root causes,
  and remediation actions.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas)
- Windows Event Logs
- Generative AI (OpenAI)
- Infrastructure Operations Concepts

## Key Outcomes
- Reduced noise by focusing only on operationally relevant events.
- Improved incident triage by generating AI-assisted insights.
- Demonstrated practical use of AI in Infrastructure Operations.

## Use Cases
- Post-patching validation
- Incident root cause analysis
- Operational risk reporting
